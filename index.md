# About me

A graphic designer and photographer. I run [Lightbox Darkroom](http://www.lightbox.photo), an open photographic darkroom, [Lightbox Gallery](http://www.lightbox.photo/gallery) in Liverpool, UK, and [Error](https://www.error.agency), a successful digital agency.

I am always willing to team up for creative work involving traditional film photography and graphic design. Contact me on the details below if you'd like to discuss ideas, get involved with Lightbox, or to discuss any other opportunities together.

A graphic designer, typographer, user experience specialist and business founder. I run [Lightbox Darkroom](http://www.lightbox.photo), an open photographic darkroom; [Ten O'Clock Books](https://www.tenoclockbooks.com), a photographic book publisher;  [Error](https://www.error.agency), a successful digital agency; and, [Humap](https://humap.me), an interactive map platform.

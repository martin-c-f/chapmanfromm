# About me

A graphic designer and photographer. I run [Lightbox Darkroom](http://www.lightbox.photo), an open photographic darkroom, [Ten O'Clock Books](https://www.tenoclockbooks.com) a photographic book publisher, and [Error](https://www.error.agency), a successful digital agency.

Want to team up for creative work involving photography book and graphic design? Contact me on the details below if you'd like to discuss ideas, get involved with Lightbox/Ten O'Clock Books, or to discuss any other opportunities together.
